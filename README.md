Thanks for visiting my corner of Github! I'm a frontend-leaning full-stack engineer with an abiding love for all things âœ¨design-related.âœ¨ I aim to make useful things, and believe that <em>all truly useful things should have an artfulness to them</em>. I also believe that the internet should look cool, stay weird, and be `accessible` for everyone! I'm always trying to stay open-minded, learn more, and challenge myself. I most enjoy working with Javascript frameworks like React and Next, but I'm always excited to tackle new things. Lately I've been writing Python scripts to manipulate a 3D data visualization software written in C and C++, which is pretty neat. I believe in a healthy work-life balance, sorry-not-sorry! Feel free to reach out and say hi. âœŒ
