<div align="center">Thanks for visiting my corner of Github! I'm a frontend-leaning Full Stack Engineer with an abiding love for all things âœ¨design-related.âœ¨ I aim to make useful things, and believe that <em>all truly useful things should have an artfulness to them</em>. I also believe it's our duty to uplift and support the voices of marginalized folks, that Black lives matter, and that the internet should look cool, stay weird, and be `accessible` for everyone! I'm always trying to stay open-minded, learn more, and challenge myself.
